# PCA
This repository contains an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. PCA is a mathematical technique used to simplify high-dimensional datasets while retaining important information.

## The Notebook covers the following topics:

**Introduction to PCA:** An overview of PCA and its purpose in reducing the complexity of high-dimensional datasets.

**PCA Mathematics:** A step-by-step explanation of the mathematical concepts involved in PCA, including standardization, covariance matrix calculation, eigendecomposition, and projection of data onto principal components.

**PCA Implementation:** Code implementation of PCA using both a *custom PCA* class and the *PCA module from scikit-learn*. The code showcases how to load data, scale it using the StandardScaler, perform PCA using custom and scikit-learn implementations, and visualize the transformed data in 2D and 3D.

**Comparison of Custom and Scikit-Learn PCA:** A comparison between the results obtained from the custom PCA implementation and the PCA implementation in scikit-learn. The results are validated by checking their equality.

**Visualization:** Visualization of the transformed data using scatter plots in 2D and 3D. The plots showcase the separation of data points based on their target labels (benign or malignant).

The Notebook aims to provide a practical understanding of PCA and offers practical examples of how to apply it to real-world datasets using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

To run the Notebook, please ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed and execute each code cell in sequential order. The Notebook can serve as a valuable reference for implementing PCA in your own projects and gaining insights into its applications in dimensionality reduction and data analysis.
